1. JEPA, or Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, is Yann LeCun's idea for smarter AI that learns like humans by predicting the future without generating every detail.
2. Current AI predicts pixels or words exactly, which is hard and wasteful for unpredictable stuff like flickering lights.
3. JEPA uses two encoders: one for visible parts (context), one for hidden parts (target), to match abstract representations of what might happen next.
4. This self-supervised method ignores noise, learns useful patterns efficiently, and avoids blurry or wrong predictions.
